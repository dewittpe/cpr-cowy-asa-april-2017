## Separating Aging from Menopause

- Motivated by a need to answer questions about aging and menopause.
    - How do reproductive hormone profiles change during the menopausal transition?
    - What is the interaction between age and time-to-menopause?
    - How do we model hormone profiles to allow for inference on the complex
      interactions between day-of-cycle, age, and time-to-menopause?

- Study of Women's Health Across the Nation (SWAN) <img width=300 height=85 src='figure/swan.png' align="right"/> Daily Hormone Study (DHS) 
    - First evacuation urine sample every day for a full menstrual cycle.
    - One cycle per year; stop collection one year post menopause or end of study.



## Proposed Modeling Approach
- Need a model to inform the relationship between reproductive hormone profiles
  with day, age, and time-to-menopause (TTM).

- Current analysis methods in the literature:
    - Singleton metrics, _e.g._, AUC, peak level, cycle length, ...
    - Fail to capture the functional form of the hormone profiles

- Proposed Modeling Approach: $$ PDG \approx f(day, age, ttm) $$
  Model $f$ via multi-variable B-splines.


## B-Splines
- An appropriate method for modeling unknown functional forms.

- Subject to the selection of a polynomial order and knot sequences

- Multi-variable B-splines can require a lot of degrees of freedom.

- Need to find a method for finding parsimonious regression models with a high
  quality of fit.

- Parsimony to alleviate over-fitting.

- Start with uni-variable B-splines and extend to multi-variable B-splines.

**Other modeling approaches:**

- P-Splines
    - Built on B-splines
    - By design a lot of degrees of freedom
    - Penalty for "wiggliness"
    - Computationally expensive, especially for mixed effect models
- Smoothing Splines
    - As many regression parameters as unique data tuples
